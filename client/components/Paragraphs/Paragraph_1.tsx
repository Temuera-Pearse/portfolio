      {`I am a software developer with a background in fabrication and manufacturing. I am 29
years old and have had the opportunity to experience many different workplaces over my
working career. I have experience working under management and experience managing
people as well. I keep calm under pressure and always strive to communicate with clients
and colleagues in a mindful and meaningful manner. I enjoy working in teams but I can
confidently work independently as well. I have the ability to learn new skills quickly and I
always aim to reinforce those skills by helping others with learning them. In my spare time
you can find me either coding personal projects, at the gym or working on other creative
projects that I like.
